    If a single description file applies to multiple models, use `x' character
    to indicate model name characters or digits that are not common. Ideally,
    though, a single description file should correspond to a single model.

    Comma-separated list of printer features. Possible values include:

    * `FilmSessionLabel' - indicates that the printer supports labelling film
      session when it is created.
      
      The Film Session Label is an optional Attribute of the Basic Film Session
      SOP Class so it shouldn't be sent if device doesn't support it. Otherwise
      an unnecessary warning response may be read from the device.

      Note, that we're only interested here in the N-CREATE message attributes,
      not N-SET.

    * `BorderDensity' - similarly to the above, indicates whether or not the
      optional attribute: Border Density of the Basic Film Box SOP class can be
      set with the N-CREATE message.

    * `EmptyImageDensity' - same as the `BorderDensity'.

    * `Trim' - same as the `BorderDensity' and `EmptyImageDensity'.

    * `HighQuality' - indicates whether or not the imager supports double-density
      printing. There are two conditions that have to be met in order to set this
      flag. First, the imager must support Requested Resolution ID Attribute in
      the Basic Film Box SOP Class and allow to set it to `HIGH' value. Secondly,
      printable areas for standard and double-density printing must differ.

    * `RequestedImageSize' - tells if imager supports the Requested Image Size
      Attribute of the Basic Grayscale Image Box SOP Class. This Attribute 
      allows to control output width down to a millimetre, which is the only way
      to produce 1:1 output on imagers that do not support `Magnification Type' = 
      `NONE'.

  <!-- II  BASIC FILM SESSION-RELATED PROPERTIES -->

  <!--
    Possible values for the Medium Type Attribute. The first one should be 
    printer's default.
    
    Any non-standard value should be omitted. Standard values include on the
    following:

    * PAPER,
    * CLEAR FILM,
    * BLUE FILM,
    * MAMMO CLEAR FILM,
    * MAMMO BLUE FILM.
  -->
  <MediumTypes>CLEAR FILM, BLUE FILM<!--, CLEAR MAMMO FILM, BLUE MAMMO FILM--></MediumTypes>

  <!--
    Possible values for the Film Destination Attribute. The first one should be
    printer's default.

    Any non-standard value should be left out. Standard values include the 
    following:

      * MAGAZINE,
      * PROCESSOR,
      * BIN_i, where `i' is an integer value, e.g. BIN_1, BIN_2, etc.

    The maximum allowed number of copies. Cannot be higher than 16000.

  <MaxCopyCount>100</MaxCopyCount>

  

  <!-- III BASIC FILM BOX-RELATED PROPERTIES -->

  <!--
    Supported values for the Film Size ID Attribute (in other words, possible
    film types). Any non-standard values should be omitted. Standard values
    include only the following:

      * A3,
		  * A4,
		  * 24CMX24CM,
		  * 24CMX30CM,
		  * 25.7CMX36.4CM

		  * 11INX14IN,
		  * 11INX17IN,
		  * 14INX14IN,
		  * 14INX17IN.

    The first value should point out printer's default.

  <!--
    Supported values for the Magnification Type Attribute. The first on should
    indicate printer's default.
    
    Only values from the standard set should be listed. The set contains the
    following values:

      * NONE,
      * REPLICATE,
      * BILINEAR,
      * CUBIC.

  <!-- IV  BASIC GRAYSCALE IMAGE BOX-RELATED PROPERTIES -->

  <!--
    Lists all possible bit depths for image data. The best way to fill this
    property is by examining allowed values for the Bits Stored Attribute.

    While DICOM standard allows only for 8- and 12-bit mode printing, some
    of the imagers support up to 16 bits. That's the only extension to DICOM
    we should consider using.

  <!--
    Provides physical resolution (in DPI) of the device, in standard and
    high resolution modes (where applicable).
    
    If unsure, look for the largest printable area and divide the number of
    pixels in Y axis by the film height. Then round up the number to the most
    common values, which include:

      * 254 DPI (100 microns),
      * 300 DPI (84.666 microns),
      * 320 DPI (79.375 microns),
      * 508 DPI (50 microns).
    
    If resolution is given by dot pitch (usually in microns), use the following
    formula to calculate DPI: [DPI] = 25400 / [microns].

  <Resolutions>
    <NormalQuality>508</NormalQuality>

  <!--
    Lists printable areas available depending on the chosen film type and
    quality (where applicable). Each spec have the following format:
    
      <film size>: <width> x <height>

    and the list is comma-separated.
    
    We're assuming vertical film alignment (width is smaller than height).
    If for some particular imager landscape and portrait areas differ from each
    other, the smaller values should be used.
    
    The same applies when printer have different areas depending on medium
    type (which happens sometimes with mammo films). In such cases always the
    smaller area should be used.

    STANDARD\1,1 format, no annotation boxes and no trim frame should be
    assumed.
